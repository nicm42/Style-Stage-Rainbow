## General info
Having learnt about Style Stage I thought it would be fun to come up with a style myself. The challenge was to only use CSS, you couldn't update the HTML at all. As long as it met the guidelines it didn't matter how it looked. And Style Stage did the auto-prefixing. I chose a Rainbow theme.
